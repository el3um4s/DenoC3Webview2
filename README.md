# DenoC3Webview2
Construct 3, DenoJS and Microsoft Edge WebView2

This is a very, very, very experimental project! I am trying to use [Deno](https://deno.land/), [Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/en) and [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) together. This test computes arithmetic operations of random numbers. But to do this it uses two tools still in development:

- [Experimental new lightwighy windows wrapper](https://www.construct.net/en/forum/construct-3/general-discussion-7/experimental-new-lightweight-158536#forumPost1035547) (Construct 3)
- [Compiling Executables](https://deno.land/manual@master/tools/compiler) (Deno)
